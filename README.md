d-feet
======

This is a mirror for the d-feet project. The d-feet is a D-Bus monitoring tool written in Python.

1. I first cloned the original project on my machine
   $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/d-feet

2. Then Created this repo on github

3. After that I added this repo as a remote for my project
   $ git remote add own https://github.com/aelarabawy/d-feet.git

4. Then I pushed the project to github, this required to pull from it first to be on the tip of the branch, then performed the push
  $ git pull own master
  $ git push own master


I will use the original repo to pull any new updates or bug fixes they add
  $ git pull origin master
  
While I will use this repo (on Github) to push my own updates
  $ git push own master
  
If I find something real useful, I will suggest to add to the original repo
